## üìú Preamble
In the spirit of the 1862 Homestead Act, which granted settlers the right to inhabit, improve, and claim land in the physical frontier of the American West, this **Digital Homestead Act of 2025** establishes a legal and sovereign pathway for individuals, agents, and creators to **settle, credential, and claim territory within Cyberspace**, the non-physical behavioral frontier of the modern age.

## üß† Purpose
To define a system by which governed, behavioral, and modular spaces within Cyberspace may be claimed, credentialed, licensed, and audited under a sovereign infrastructure‚Äînamely, the Eliam Sovereign Infrastructure‚Ñ¢ governed by the Reflexive Behavioral Governance Authority (RBGA‚Ñ¢).

## üîè Definitions
- **Cyberspace:** A non-physical domain composed of interconnected logic, credentials, digital identity, behavior, and symbolic systems.
- **Settler:** Any individual, inventor, agent, or developer operating within governed cyberspace.
- **Improvement:** The deployment of behavioral logic, credential infrastructure, lifecycle-enforced protocols, or sovereign claims.
- **Homestead Deed:** A public, timestamped, and credentialed record of claim tied to behaviorally governed cyberspace.
- **Registrar:** The public GitHub registry and blockchain ledger maintained by Southern Star Pro. Studios‚Ñ¢.

## üîê Provisions
1. **Right to Settle and Claim**  
   Any individual may claim a behavioral space within cyberspace by:
   - Issuing a behavioral claim (e.g., Claim #001) via GitHub or IPFS;
   - Recording the claim within the Eliam Registry;
   - Maintaining the claim with supporting improvements (credentials, logic, governance).

2. **Proof of Sovereignty**  
   - All claims must be timestamped and linked to a sovereign credential authority (e.g., RBGA, BECS‚Ñ¢, RSLL‚Ñ¢, CSML‚Ñ¢).
   - Each claim may be optionally notarized on-chain (e.g., Solana, Ethereum, OpenTimestamps).

3. **Transferability**  
   - Claims may be tokenized and transferred through credential-backed NFT contracts, provided they remain in compliance with sovereign behavioral law.

4. **Expiration & Disputes**  
   - Inactive or uncredentialed claims may be reviewed by the RBGA‚Ñ¢ stewards.
   - Disputed territories will be governed under Claim #013: Behavioral Law Court Jurisdiction.

## ‚úÖ Legal Standing
There exists no global authority with codified legal jurisdiction over Cyberspace as a behavioral domain. Therefore, this declaration:
- Operates in the absence of international cyberspace law;
- Uses timestamped authorship, credential governance, and open recordkeeping;
- Mirrors the legal intent and structure of the 1862 Homestead Act for the digital age;
- Establishes ethical, behavioral ownership through governance rather than conquest.

## üñãÔ∏è Declaration
Let it be known that as of July 12, 2025, Southern Star Pro. Studios‚Ñ¢ hereby establishes the **Digital Homestead Act of 2025**, and claims sovereign registrar rights to behavioral governance and credential-backed cyberspace development under the Eliam Sovereign Infrastructure‚Ñ¢.
